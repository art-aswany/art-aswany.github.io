# Chapter 3: Day 3 - Discovering Your Core Values
## What Truly Matters to Your Authentic Self

---

*"Values aren't what you think you should care aboutâ€”they're what makes you feel alive when honored and sick when violated. Today we discover what truly matters to your authentic self."*

Welcome to Day 3. Over the past two days, you've begun unmasking your authentic identity and understanding your personality foundation. Today we explore perhaps the most crucial element of authentic living: **your core values.**

Values are often misunderstood. They're not moral platitudes or inherited beliefs about what's "right." Your authentic values are the fundamental principles that energize and guide your authentic self. They're what matter most to who you really are, not who you think you should be.

When your life aligns with your authentic values, you experience deep satisfaction, energy, and purpose. When your choices violate these values, you feel drained, conflicted, and spiritually emptyâ€”even if those choices look successful to others.

Today's mission: **Identify your authentic core values, prioritize them into a personal hierarchy, and create a values-based decision-making framework.**

## Values vs. Shoulds: The Great Distinction


![authentic_vs_imposed_values.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/art-aswany/art-aswany.github.io/main/authentic/Images/authentic_vs_imposed_values.svg)


Before we can discover your authentic values, we must distinguish between **authentic values** (what genuinely matters to you) and **imposed shoulds** (what you've been told should matter).

**Understanding Imposed "Shoulds":**

**Family Values Inheritance:** From childhood, we absorb our family's values as if they were our own. A family that prioritizes financial security might raise children who think they "should" value wealth, even if their authentic self is drawn to creativity or service.

*American Example: Jake, a software engineer in Austin, spent fifteen years pursuing financial success because his immigrant parents valued economic security above all else. Despite achieving a six-figure salary, he felt empty until he realized his authentic value was community building, not wealth accumulation.*

**Cultural Value Pressure:** Society promotes certain values as universally importantâ€”success, achievement, independence, productivity. But what if your authentic self values collaboration over competition, or process over results?

*European Example: Astrid, a manager in Stockholm, felt constant pressure to value "work-life balance" because Swedish culture prioritizes it. But her authentic value was passionate engagementâ€”she actually thrived on intense work periods followed by complete rest, not daily balance.*

**Professional Value Adoption:** Career environments often require adopting their values to succeed. Over years, we can mistake these professional values for personal ones.

*International Example: Kwame, a consultant in Accra, adopted his firm's values of efficiency and rapid results. But his authentic values centered on thorough understanding and relationship building. Once he honored these authentic values, his work became both more satisfying and more effective.*

**Religious/Ideological Value Imposition:** Spiritual or ideological communities often prescribe what members should value. While some alignment is natural, total adoption without personal examination can bury authentic values.

**The Psychological Cost of Values Misalignment:**

When we live according to imposed values rather than authentic ones, the psychological toll is measurable and significant:

**Decision Paralysis:** When facing choices, you feel confused or overwhelmed because you lack clear internal guidance.

**Success Without Satisfaction:** You achieve goals that look good but feel empty because they align with imposed values rather than authentic ones.

**Chronic Resentment:** You feel angry or bitter about your life choices, even when they seem "right" by external standards.

**Energy Drain:** Activities that should feel meaningful instead feel like obligations you "should" care about.

**Relationship Conflicts:** You clash with others over what seems important, but you can't articulate why these things matter to you.

**Physical Symptoms:** Research shows that chronic values violations can manifest as:
- Persistent fatigue despite adequate rest
- Digestive issues and sleep disturbances
- Increased susceptibility to illness
- Tension headaches and muscle pain
- Anxiety and depression symptoms

## The Values Excavation Process

Discovering your authentic values requires archaeological precision. Like uncovering ancient artifacts, we must carefully brush away layers of conditioning to reveal what's genuinely yours.

**Exercise 1: Values Archaeology - Mining Peak Experiences**


ðŸ‘‰ Explore this interactive tool: [View resource: 09_Core_Values_Discovery_Guide.html](https://art-aswany.github.io/art-aswany.github.io/authentic/Resources/09_Core_Values_Discovery_Guide.html)



*Time Required: 20 minutes*

Your most fulfilling experiences contain clues to your authentic values. These peak moments happen when your choices align perfectly with what truly matters to you.

**Part A: Peak Experience Identification**

List 5-7 experiences from your life when you felt:
- Deeply fulfilled and energized
- Completely aligned with yourself
- Proud in a way that felt authentic (not performative)
- Connected to something meaningful
- Time seemed to disappear because you were so engaged

**For each experience, analyze:**
- **What were you doing specifically?**
- **What principles or ideals were being honored?**
- **What felt most important in that moment?**
- **What would have been violated if you had acted differently?**
- **What underlying value was being expressed?**

*American Example: Maria, a marketing director in Denver, identified her peak experience as organizing a community garden in her neighborhood. Analyzing this revealed her authentic values: environmental stewardship, community building, and hands-on creationâ€”very different from the competition and individual achievement her career emphasized.*

*European Example: FranÃ§ois, an accountant in Lyon, recalled his most fulfilling experience: spending three months helping his grandfather restore an old farmhouse. This revealed his authentic values of craftsmanship, generational connection, and working with his handsâ€”values his corporate career completely ignored.*

*International Example: Aisha, a project manager in Cairo, identified peak experiences around mediating family conflicts and helping friends navigate difficult decisions. This revealed her authentic values of harmony, wisdom-sharing, and relational healingâ€”qualities her technical work environment didn't utilize.*

**Part B: Values Extraction**

From your peak experience analysis, extract potential core values. Look for patterns across different experiences:

**Universal Value Categories:**


![universal_values_circle.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/art-aswany/art-aswany.github.io/main/authentic/Images/universal_values_circle.svg)

*(Based on extensive cross-cultural research by Schwartz et al., 2012, and updated through contemporary global values surveys)*

- **Achievement:** Excellence, success, accomplishment, mastery
- **Adventure:** Exploration, risk-taking, novelty, excitement  
- **Autonomy:** Independence, self-direction, freedom, choice
- **Beauty:** Aesthetics, harmony, elegance, artistic expression
- **Community:** Belonging, connection, collaboration, teamwork
- **Compassion:** Service, helping others, alleviating suffering
- **Creativity:** Innovation, artistic expression, imagination, originality
- **Family:** Relationships, generational connection, care for loved ones
- **Growth:** Learning, development, continuous improvement, evolution
- **Health:** Physical wellbeing, vitality, fitness, longevity
- **Integrity:** Honesty, authenticity, moral consistency, truthfulness
- **Justice:** Fairness, equality, rights, social responsibility
- **Knowledge:** Understanding, wisdom, truth-seeking, expertise
- **Leadership:** Influence, guidance, vision-casting, inspiring others
- **Nature:** Environmental connection, outdoor activities, sustainability
- **Peace:** Tranquility, harmony, conflict resolution, serenity
- **Pleasure:** Enjoyment, fun, celebration, sensory experience
- **Recognition:** Appreciation, acknowledgment, status, reputation
- **Security:** Stability, safety, predictability, financial comfort
- **Spirituality:** Transcendence, meaning, connection to something greater
- **Tradition:** Cultural heritage, customs, established ways, continuity

**Exercise 2: The Values Sorting Process**


ðŸ‘‰ Explore this interactive tool: [View resource: 10_Values_Hierarchy_Worksheet.html](https://art-aswany.github.io/art-aswany.github.io/authentic/Resources/10_Values_Hierarchy_Worksheet.html)



*Time Required: 15 minutes*

Now we'll narrow down to your core values using a systematic sorting process.

**Round 1: Initial Sort**
From the value categories above, select 15-20 that resonated when you read them. Don't overthinkâ€”choose based on immediate recognition.

**Round 2: Story Testing**
For each selected value, ask: "Can I tell a specific story from my life when honoring this value created deep satisfaction?" If you can't think of a concrete example, eliminate it.

**Round 3: Energy Assessment**
For remaining values, imagine living them fully. Which ones create energy and excitement? Which feel like obligations? Keep only those that energize you.

**Round 4: Conflict Resolution**
Choose your top 10 values. Now imagine scenarios where they might conflict:
- Achievement vs. Family (working late vs. family dinner)
- Autonomy vs. Community (independent decision vs. group consensus)
- Adventure vs. Security (risky opportunity vs. stable situation)

Notice which values you're willing to sacrifice for others. This reveals your hierarchy.

**Round 5: Core Values Selection**
Narrow to your top 5-7 core values. These should be:
- Energizing when honored
- Painful when violated
- Consistent across different life areas
- Uniquely important to you (not just socially acceptable)

*American Example: Tom, an operations manager in Phoenix, discovered his core values were: Craftsmanship, Autonomy, Environmental Stewardship, Problem-Solving, and Quiet Excellence. This explained why his corporate role felt draining despite successâ€”it honored problem-solving but violated his needs for craftsmanship, autonomy, and environmental connection.*

*European Example: Ingrid, a teacher in Copenhagen, identified her core values as: Cultural Bridge-Building, Deep Learning, Aesthetic Beauty, Peaceful Environments, and Intergenerational Wisdom. Understanding these helped her see why standard classroom teaching felt limitingâ€”she needed more cultural exchange and aesthetic integration.*

*International Example: Rashid, an engineer in Dubai, found his core values were: Innovation, Community Service, Family Honor, Intellectual Challenge, and Collaborative Creation. This revealed why his individual contributor role felt isolatingâ€”his authentic values required community and collaboration.*

## Your Values Hierarchy: Navigating Competing Priorities

Life constantly presents situations where values conflict. Your values hierarchyâ€”the relative priority of your core valuesâ€”provides guidance for these difficult decisions.

**Exercise 3: Values Conflict Resolution**


ðŸ‘‰ Explore this interactive tool: [View resource: 11_Values_Conflict_Resolution_Framework.html](https://art-aswany.github.io/art-aswany.github.io/authentic/Resources/11_Values_Conflict_Resolution_Framework.html)



*Time Required: 15 minutes*

**Scenario Testing Method:**

For each pair of your core values, imagine a scenario where you must choose between them. Which would you honor if forced to choose?

**Cultural Considerations in Values Conflicts:**

Different cultures experience values conflicts differently, which affects how you might prioritize your hierarchy:

**American Cultural Context:** Individual achievement often conflicts with community needs. The cultural emphasis on self-reliance can make choosing personal values over group harmony more acceptable.

**European Cultural Context:** Work-life balance conflicts with achievement ambition. The cultural framework often provides more support for choosing life harmony over professional advancement.

**International/Collectivist Contexts:** Individual authenticity often conflicts with family or community expectations. The cultural pressure to prioritize group harmony can make personal values choices feel selfish or disrespectful.

**Example Conflict Scenarios:**

**Family vs. Career Growth:**
"You're offered a promotion that requires relocating away from aging parents who need support. Which matters more: career advancement or family proximity?"

**Autonomy vs. Financial Security:**
"You can either keep a stable job with micromanagement or start your own business with financial uncertainty. Which matters more: independence or security?"

**Achievement vs. Community:**
"You can either pursue an individual award that requires competing against teammates or support the team's success without personal recognition. Which matters more: personal achievement or group harmony?"

**Create similar scenarios for your specific values and note your instinctive choices.**

**Ranking Your Values:**

After scenario testing, rank your core values from most to least important:

1. **Primary Value:** The one you'd never compromise
2. **Secondary Values:** Important but flexible in extreme circumstances  
3. **Supporting Values:** Meaningful but subordinate to higher values

*American Example: Sarah, a consultant in Seattle, ranked her values: 1) Integrity, 2) Family Connection, 3) Creative Expression, 4) Environmental Stewardship, 5) Personal Growth. This hierarchy helped her choose ethical clients (integrity) over high-paying but questionable ones, even when money was tight.*

*European Example: Andreas, a designer in Berlin, ranked his values: 1) Aesthetic Excellence, 2) Work-Life Harmony, 3) Cultural Innovation, 4) Collaborative Creation, 5) Financial Stability. This hierarchy guided him to choose design projects that prioritized beauty and balance over purely profitable but aesthetically compromising work.*

*International Example: Fatima, a social worker in Casablanca, ranked her values: 1) Community Service, 2) Family Honor, 3) Personal Autonomy, 4) Spiritual Growth, 5) Professional Recognition. This hierarchy helped her navigate cultural tensions between traditional family expectations and her calling to serve marginalized communities.*

## Creating Your Values Compass: A Decision-Making Framework


![values_decision_compass.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/art-aswany/art-aswany.github.io/main/authentic/Images/values_decision_compass.svg)


With your core values identified and prioritized, you can create a practical framework for making authentic decisions in any situation.

**Exercise 4: Your Personal Values Compass**


![values_decision_compass.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/art-aswany/art-aswany.github.io/main/authentic/Images/values_decision_compass.svg)



*Time Required: 20 minutes*

**Part A: Values Statement Creation**

Create a personal values statement for each core value:

**Format:** "I value [VALUE NAME] which means [SPECIFIC DEFINITION] and shows up in my life as [CONCRETE BEHAVIORS]."

**Examples:**

*"I value Integrity, which means aligning my actions with my authentic beliefs even when it's difficult, and this shows up as honest communication, keeping commitments, and choosing ethical options even when they cost me."*

*"I value Creative Expression, which means bringing original ideas into tangible form, and this shows up as making time for artistic projects, finding innovative solutions at work, and surrounding myself with beautiful, inspiring environments."*

**Part B: Values Compass Decision Framework**

Create a systematic approach for making values-based decisions:

**Step 1: Values Check**
*"Which of my core values are relevant to this decision?"*

**Step 2: Alignment Assessment**
*"How well does each option align with my prioritized values?"*

**Step 3: Hierarchy Application**
*"If values conflict, which higher-priority value should guide me?"*

**Step 4: Authentic Choice**
*"What decision most honors my authentic values hierarchy?"*

**Step 5: Integrity Implementation**
*"How do I implement this decision in a way that fully honors my values?"*

*American Example: Kevin, a sales manager in Chicago, used his values compass when offered a promotion. His core values were Family Connection (1), Integrity (2), Personal Growth (3), Financial Security (4). The promotion offered growth and money but required extensive travel away from his young children. His values compass clearly indicated declining the promotion to honor his primary value of family connection.*

*European Example: Sophie, a consultant in Amsterdam, applied her values compass to a career change decision. Her values were Intellectual Challenge (1), Collaborative Creation (2), Work-Life Balance (3), Cultural Impact (4). Using this framework, she chose a university research position over a higher-paying corporate role because it better honored her top three values.*

*International Example: Hiroshi, a project manager in Tokyo, used his values compass when his company asked him to implement layoffs. His values were Team Harmony (1), Honest Communication (2), Excellence (3), Company Loyalty (4). His compass guided him to transparently communicate the situation to his team and work collaboratively to find alternatives to layoffs, even when this challenged company directives.*

**Part C: Values Boundaries**


![values_boundaries_map.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/art-aswany/art-aswany.github.io/main/authentic/Images/values_boundaries_map.svg)


Define clear boundaries based on your values:

**Values-Based "Yes" Criteria:**
*"I will say yes to opportunities that..."*
- Honor my top 3 core values
- Allow me to use my authentic strengths
- Align with my personality foundation
- Create energy rather than drain it

**Values-Based "No" Criteria:**
*"I will say no to opportunities that..."*
- Require violating my core values
- Force me to act against my authentic nature
- Create chronic stress from misalignment
- Demand sacrificing higher values for lower ones

## Values in Relationships: Communicating What Matters


![values_communication_model.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/art-aswany/art-aswany.github.io/main/authentic/Images/values_communication_model.svg)


One of the most challenging aspects of authentic living is honoring your values within relationships that may not share or understand them.

**Exercise 5: Values Communication Strategy**


![values_communication_model.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/art-aswany/art-aswany.github.io/main/authentic/Images/values_communication_model.svg)



*Time Required: 15 minutes*

**Relationship Values Assessment:**

For your key relationships (family, spouse, close friends, colleagues), assess:

**Shared Values:** Which of your core values do you share with this person?
**Conflicting Values:** Where do your values fundamentally differ?
**Hidden Values:** Which of your authentic values have you not shared with this person?
**Accommodation Patterns:** Where do you regularly compromise your values to maintain this relationship?

**Values Communication Framework:**

**Step 1: Choose the Right Moment**
Values conversations require calm, unrushed time when both people can listen deeply.

**Step 2: Share Your Discovery**
*"I've been doing some deep thinking about what matters most to me, and I'd like to share what I've discovered..."*

**Step 3: Explain the Impact**
*"Understanding my values helps explain why [specific situations] have been challenging for me..."*

**Step 4: Request Understanding**
*"I'm not asking you to share these values, but understanding them would help our relationship..."*

**Step 5: Negotiate Boundaries**
*"Given these values, I need to [specific behavioral changes] and I hope you can support this..."*

*American Example: Lisa, a marketing director in Portland, realized her value of Environmental Stewardship was causing tension with her consumption-focused friends. She used values communication to explain why she was choosing different leisure activities and asked for understanding rather than pressure to participate in shopping-based socializing.*

*European Example: Pierre, a teacher in Paris, discovered his value of Deep Learning conflicted with his school's emphasis on test preparation. He communicated his values to his principal and negotiated space to incorporate more meaningful learning experiences while still meeting testing requirements.*

*International Example: Mei, a project manager in Singapore, found her value of Collaborative Harmony clashed with her company's competitive individual performance culture. She shared her values with her manager and created team-based projects that honored both her collaborative nature and company results.*

**Handling Values Conflicts in Relationships:**

**When Others Pressure You to Violate Your Values:**
- Stay calm and reaffirm your commitment to your authentic principles
- Explain the personal cost of violating these values
- Offer alternative ways to meet the other person's underlying needs
- Be willing to accept relationship changes if values are incompatible

**When Your Values Seem to Hurt Others:**
- Distinguish between honoring your values and imposing them on others
- Find ways to live your values that minimize impact on others
- Communicate your intent to honor your authentic self, not to reject others
- Seek creative solutions that honor both your values and their needs

---

## The Courage to Live Your Values

Knowing your values intellectually is different from having the courage to live them, especially when doing so challenges social expectations or costs you opportunities.

**Common Values Courage Challenges:**

**The Financial Pressure Challenge:** When living your values might reduce income or career advancement.

**The Family Expectations Challenge:** When your authentic values conflict with family traditions or expectations.

**The Social Acceptance Challenge:** When your values make you different from your social group.

**The Convenience Challenge:** When living your values requires more effort than compromising them.

**Building Values Courage:**

**Start Small:** Begin honoring your values in low-stakes situations to build confidence.

**Find Support:** Connect with others who share your values or respect your authenticity.

**Remember Your Why:** Regularly reconnect with why these values matter to your authentic self.

**Celebrate Values Wins:** Acknowledge when you successfully honor your values, especially in difficult situations.

**Learn From Compromises:** When you compromise your values, study what happened and plan differently next time.

**Wisdom Quote Integration:**

*"It's not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are." - Roy Disney*

Clarity about your authentic values transforms decision-making from an analytical exercise into an intuitive process guided by your deepest truths.

*"The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself." - Michel de Montaigne*

Living according to your authentic values is how you truly belong to yourself rather than to others' expectations.
